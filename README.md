## Installation

Eventually I hope to get this released on PyPi, but for now it is only installable by downloading the repo and installing it into Python manually.

1) Clone the Git Repo
2) Change directory into the repo
3) Install the Repo with setup.py

```
git clone git@github.com:piskuliche/EmpiricalMapping.git
cd EmpiricalMapping
pip install -e .
```
